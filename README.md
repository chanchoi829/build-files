This repo contains the QNX-specific build files needed to build certain ports and projects. Most QNX ports have their own sub-directory under `ports/` in this repo. Look at the `README.md` file in a project's sub-directory for specific build instructions for that port.

You can build ports on your host, but we highly recommend using the prepared Docker image for a consistent build environment. You can find more information about building using the Docker-based build environment in `docker/README.md`.
